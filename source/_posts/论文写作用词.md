# 英语语法

## 定语从句

定语从句是英语中的一个重要语法概念，用于修饰名词或代词，提供更详细的信息或描述。定语从句通常由关系代词（如that, which, who, whom, whose）或关系副词（如when, where, why）引导，它们在从句中担任特定的语法功能。

以下是定语从句的一些基本要点和示例：

1. **关系代词**：

2. - **that** 和 **which** 用于修饰事物。

   - - 示例：The book **that** I bought yesterday is very       interesting.（我昨天买的那本书很有趣。）
     - 注意：在限制性定语从句中，如果先行词是不定代词（如all, everything, something, nothing等）或先行词被序数词、最高级、the only, the very等修饰时，通常使用that。

   - **who** 和 **whom** 用于修饰人。

   - - 示例：The man **who** spoke to me was my teacher.（和我说话的那个人是我的老师。）
     - 注意：在口语和非正式书面语中，有时可以用that或which代替who或whom。

   - **whose** 用于表示所有关系。

   - - 示例：The girl **whose** car was stolen called the police.（车被偷的那个女孩报了警。）

3. **关系副词**：

4. - **when** 用于表示时间。

   - - 示例：I remember the day **when** we first met.（我记得我们第一次见面的那天。）

   - **where** 用于表示地点。

   - - 示例：This is the place **where** I grew up.（这是我成长的地方。）

   - **why** 用于表示原因（较少见，通常可以用that或for which替代）。

   - - 示例：I don't know the reason **why** he is late.（我不知道他为什么迟到。）

5. **限制性定语从句与非限制性定语从句**：

6. - **限制性定语从句**提供必要的信息，没有它，句子的意义就不完整。限制性定语从句与主句之间没有逗号分隔。
   - **非限制性定语从句**提供额外的信息，没有它，句子的基本意义仍然完整。非限制性定语从句与主句之间有逗号分隔。

7. **省略关系代词的情况**：

8. - 在某些情况下，尤其是非正式场合，关系代词可以被省略，特别是当定语从句很短且关系代词在从句中担任宾语时。
   - 示例：I like movies (that) you recommended.（我喜欢你推荐的电影。）

掌握定语从句的关键在于理解关系代词和关系副词的作用，以及它们在句子中的语法功能。通过多读多写，你可以逐渐熟悉并熟练使用定语从句。

 

### 限制性定语从句

限制性定语从句提供了对名词或代词的必要信息，使得句子的意义更加明确和具体。限制性定语从句与它所修饰的名词或代词紧密相连，不能省略，否则句子的意思会变得不完整或模糊。限制性定语从句与主句之间通常没有逗号分隔。

例如：

- The book **that     I read last night** was very interesting.（我昨晚读的那本书很有趣。）

在这个例子中，“that I read last night”是一个限制性定语从句，它限定了“the book”的具体内容，即“我昨晚读的那本”。如果我们去掉这个定语从句，句子的意思就会变得不明确。

### 非限制性定语从句

非限制性定语从句提供了关于名词或代词的额外信息，但并不限制其意义。非限制性定语从句与主句之间通常用逗号分隔，即使去掉非限制性定语从句，主句的意思仍然完整。非限制性定语从句主要用于补充、解释或附加说明主句的内容。

例如：

- My house, **which     was built in the 1950s**, is in need of repair.（我的房子，建于20世纪50年代，需要修理。）

在这个例子中，“which was built in the 1950s”是一个非限制性定语从句，它提供了关于“my house”的额外信息，但并不限制“my house”的含义。即使我们去掉这个定语从句，句子的基本意思——“我的房子需要修理”——仍然是完整的。

### 总结

- **限制性定语从句**：提供必要信息，不能省略，没有逗号分隔，限定名词或代词的具体含义。
- **非限制性定语从句**：提供额外信息，可以省略，有逗号分隔，不限制名词或代词的含义。

理解限制性定语从句和非限制性定语从句的区别对于正确使用定语从句和构建清晰、准确的句子非常重要。通过多读多写，你可以逐渐熟悉并掌握这两种定语从句的用法
